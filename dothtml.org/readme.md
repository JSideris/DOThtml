# Documentation #

This readme is a place for planning DOThtml 6 documentation. There's a few approaches we can take for documentation.

1. Knowledge base. Users can search for topics they need help with. Allows us to build up a tremendous amount of misc documentation but gets messy, hard to follow, hard to learn, and difficult to modify.
2. Curriculum. The information will be presented in a way that facilitates learning the framework from scratch.

I think that because this is a brand-new framework, the curriculum method is probably preferrable. The topics can roughly follow the order of the test cases,
since generally speaking the tests go from testing basic functionality to increasingly complex functionality. It would also be cool if we colud have an inspection glass that could appear under certain user input which showed the underlying component structure of the website itself and possibly the source code.

## Website ##

The website will be "3D" HTML that's been transformed using CSS. It will be super modern with lots of pretty features and interactive components. 

For the documentation pages, it would be cool to have a pane resembling a holographic projection that vanishes then reappears with new content. We could also do an animated hue shift, etc.
